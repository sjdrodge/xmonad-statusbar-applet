INTRODUCTION
============

XMonad Statusbar Applet is a Gnome Panel Applet designed for use with the
XMonad window manager <http://xmonad.org/>. It relies on XMonad to broadcast
log information via DBus; therefore, to use it properly you will have edit
your XMonad configuration. Information on how to do this is provided below.


INSTALLATION
============

See the file 'INSTALL' for information on building with ./configure and make.
Note however that the default prefix for this package is '/usr' (not
'/usr/local' as INSTALL suggests).

If you don't have a release version (e.g., you got the source code using git)
then you will need to have autotools installed. 'autoreconf --install' should
usually be enough to get to a buildable state.


BUGS
====

Please report any bugs you find to the author (see AUTHORS). The subject of

CONFIGURING XMONAD
==================

XMonad provides a general mechanism for communicating with external statusbar
programs in the form of the Pretty Printer:
<http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Hooks-DynamicLog.html>.
In order to use this with XMonad Statusbar Applet, you'll have to create a
Pretty Printer that generates valid pango markup and then broadcasts it via a
DBus signal. An example configuration which does this properly can be found at:
<https://github.com/tehminkeh/xmonad-config>.
