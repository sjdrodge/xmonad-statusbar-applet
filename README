INTRODUCTION
============

XMonad Statusbar Applet is a Gnome Panel Applet designed for use with the
XMonad window manager <http://xmonad.org/>. It relies on XMonad to broadcast
log information via DBus; therefore, to use it properly you will have edit
your XMonad configuration. Information on how to do this is provided below.


INSTALLATION
============

See the file 'INSTALL' for information on building with ./configure and make.
Note however that the default prefix for this package is '/usr' (not
'/usr/local' as INSTALL suggests).

If you don't have a release version (e.g., you got the source code using git)
then you will need to have autotools installed. 'autoreconf --install' should
usually be enough to get to a buildable state.


BUGS
====

Please report any bugs you find to the author (see AUTHORS). The subject of
